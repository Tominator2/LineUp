# LineUp

This is some Java code I wrote back in 2012 to find layouts for the coloured line connecting game Line Up that use all 90 cards.

You can find images showing all 90 of the cards [here](https://github.com/Tominator2/LineUp/issues/1).


Here's an example of the HTML output for one of the layouts:
